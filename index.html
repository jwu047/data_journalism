                    <h2>General Observations</h2>
                    <p>Obesity, smoking, and lacking healthcare percentage all positively correlate with poverty
                        percentage.
                        From our visualization, we see that smoking has a slightly more positively correlated with
                        poverty than the other two.
                        While it seems older populations generally tend to have a higher population that smokes,
                        they also seem to not lack healthcare, or have a negative correlation.
                    </p>
                    <p>When looking at percentage of the population that smokes and percentage in poverty, we see a
                        positive correlation.
                        Utah does seem to be an extreme value in this case with only 11.7% of the population in poverty
                        and only having 9.7% of the population smoke.
                        Since household income and poverty percentage has a negative correlation.
                        Percentage of the population that smokes does tend to decrease as the household median income
                        increases.
                    </p>
                    <p>As the rate of poverty increases, the population tend to have a higher obesity rate,
                        have a population that more generally smokes, and lack healthcare. It seems that Utah has
                        a younger population that while, has an average obesity rate, has a lower population that
                        smokes.
                        Meanwhile Texas, also having a younger population has a higher than average obesity rate, but
                        more noticeably
                        has a population that lacks healthcare. While only having a median population age of around 34,
                        24.9% of the population
                        does not have healthcare. Thankfully this data is in 2014 and around 2019, Texas has seen major
                        improvements regarding its population's healthcare.
